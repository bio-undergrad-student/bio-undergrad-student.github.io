    What are algorithms?
</div>
</h2>
<p>An algorithm is essentially a set of instructions. Think about writing a bulleted list of everything you’d want a robot to do in sequential order. Take a look at the following example where we come up with a simple algorithm to retrieve a strawberry from a refrigerator.</p>
<p>Move forward 3 steps → Move left 2 steps → Raise arm → Grab refrigerator door → Open refrigerator → Find strawberry → Grab strawberry → Put strawberry in basket → Close refrigerator door → Turn around → Move forward 2 steps → Move right 3 steps → Drop basket on target</p>
<p>This is basically just a sequence of steps that the robot must follow, this is a very simple example of an algorithm. In practice we would have to translate each step into a code version, but that is secondary to designing algorithms.</p>

    Basic Coding Refresher
</div>
</h3>
<p>Knowing basic coding operations is crucial in developing algorithms. The two main control structures we are concerned with are the if-else statement and for loop. These are the most frequently used in writing algorithms and it is important to understand exactly how they work.</p>
<p>In the example of a real strawberry retrieving robot we have to specify exactly what we want from it using a programming language. Below is an example of what an instruction might look like in Python.</p>
<pre><code>if is_in_refrigerator(strawberry) == true
    Robot.retrieve_item(strawberry)
else
    Robot.return()
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we wanted to use a for loop to retrieve multiple strawberries then we could use the following instruction &hellip;</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10)
    if is_in_refrigerator(strawberry) == true
        Robot.retrieve_item(strawberry)
    else
        Robot.return()
</code></pre>

    What makes a good algorithm?
</div>
</h3>
<p>Whether an algorithm is considered good depends on the many qualities of that algorithm. Two of the most important qualities of an algorithm are space and time.</p>
<p>Now what does space and time mean in the context of something running on a computer? Space refers to the amount of information that an algorithm saves during runtime. An example of space would be if we were required to store location information in our strawberry retrieval algorithm in order to backtrack and get back to our starting point. For systems such as robots that run on tight memory limitations, being mindful of memory usage is very important.</p>
<p>Time is often thought to be the most important factor when designing an algorithm. Here time refers not to the literal wall clock time your algorithm runs in but rather the asymptotic complexity. The best way to think of time complexity is to think of your algorithm as a function of the input size. So ask yourself &ldquo;as my input size increases how much additional work do I have to do?&rdquo; As an example lets think about the time complexity of the code below using a for loop&hellip;</p>
<pre><code>n = len(input)
for i in range(n)
     print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a for loop that runs in time proportional to the size of the input. In this case we say that the algorithm runs in $O(n)$ or &ldquo;big O of n time&rdquo;. This means the algorithm runtime grows in a linear fashion with respect to the input size much like the function $f(x) = x$. Below is a visual of the different common time complexities you may encounter when developing algorithms.</p>

</h2>
<p>Most of the algorithms we first learn about in computer science courses are very basic, we are tasked with completing tasks such as ordering a list of numbers or finding the maximum element in that list. In this section of the algorithms primer you will learn a bit about these two tasks in an interactive way. The two tasks are formally known as searching and sorting tasks and by the end of this section you will implement your own list searching and sorting algorithms.</p>

    Data Structures
</div>
</h3>
<p>Before starting on algorithm development, it is important to be aware of various data structures. In this tutorial we are only concerned with the list or array, but there exists a wide variety of data structures each of which have their purpose and can help algorithms run faster. So lets learn a little more about our friend the list/array, as with most data structures we associate a time complexity to the operations we can perform on the structure. Here we have three distinct tasks i.e. insertion, deletion, and query.</p>
<p><strong>Insertion</strong> of an element into a list in $O(1)$ or &ldquo;constant&rdquo; time because we simply add it to the end of the list effortlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Deletion</strong> of an element in a list can get a little complicated. If the element we want to delete just happens to be the last element in the list then we can achieve a deletion in $O(1)$. However, suppose the element we want to delete just happens to be the first in the list, now we&rsquo;d have to delete the first element then shift the remaining elements forward by one. Here we now have a $O(n)$ operation since we are required to work with each element at one time.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong> or searching of a particular element in a list is similar to the example of deletion. For querying we have to search through our various elements and check for a match, this mean manually checking each and every element at least once. So the time complexity of querying an element in a list is $O(n)$. Later in this tutorial you will have the chance to implement an algorithm to perform this query operation.</p>

    Searching/Querying Tasks
</div>
</h3>
<p>A searching task is exactly what it sounds like, generally our goal is to search for a particular element within a data structure which is what holds our data. In this part of the tutorial our main objective will be to find a particular number within a list. More formally this problem is defined as searching for a particular integer value within an array. Take the list below as an example&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><img src="/images/array.png" alt="Sunset"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is simple enough for us to determine if the number 5 is in the list, we can just look at it, for the computer it is a bit more complicated than that, we have to explicitly tell it how to know if a number is present. This is something we have to get used to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong> What is the simplest way to have the computer tell us if a known number is present in a list?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have an array named myList, and we can query the fourth element in the list as follows&hellip;</p>
<pre><code>myNumber = myList[3]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong> Write some code to tell us if the 6th element in the list is equal to 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we apply a conditional statement to all elements in an array of unknown length? Regardless of what the size of an array is at runtime we can retrieve that number using the length function i.e. <code>len(myList)</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong> Write some code to check all elements of the list to see if they are equal to 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s cool, but now imagine that we are given a stream of queries and we don’t know what the numbers are, how can we check if all of these numbers are present in our array? Suppose we have two arrays now, we have myList and we have a new array named queries. This is a list containing random numbers, our goal is to for each number in queries, check if it is present in myList.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong> Now lets generalize, write an algorithm to search the myList array for all of the numbers in the queries array.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations, you just wrote an algorithm to query lists of integers!</p>
<h3 id="sorting-tasks" >
<div>
    <a href="#sorting-tasks">

    Sorting Tasks
</div>
</h3>
<p>Now lets try a different, and more challenging, example, this time we want to take a list of numbers and sort them in increasing order. To write an algorithm for this problem we will take the same approach as we did for searching and try to solve simpler instances of the problem and then generalize.</p>
<p>Lets start with an example of a list of size 2. What is the simplest way to sort the list below of size 2? Don’t think about the code for now just think about what the flowchart would look like.</p>
<p>Assume you have access to a swap function that work as in the example below…</p>
<pre><code>myList = [1,2,3,4,5]

swap(myList[0],myList[1])

print(myList) # Output: [2,1,3,4,5]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong> Implement some code to sort a list of numbers of size 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<pre><code>if myList[0] &gt; myList[1]
        swap(myList[0], myList[1])
        return myList
else
        return myList
</code></pre>
<p>This code essentially asks one fundamental question i.e. is the first element smaller than the second? Now we are going to make a intellectual jump in order to generalize this problem, think about the following idea to sort a list of arbitrary size.</p>
<p>What process would you use in order to solve this problem on a list of size 3 like the one below?</p>
<p>What if we ask this same fundamental question repeatedly on sublists of a larger list. Take the list below as an example, first we will ask the same question from earlier “is the first element smaller than all subsequent numbers” the only difference is that we are now talking about all the numbers that follow. Next we will ask the same question but starting at the second index, ignoring all prior elements. We will repeat this process until we are left with only the last two elements, before we know it our list will be in increasing order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 6</strong> Write some code that will sort an array of integers using the idea above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(myList))
    for j in range(i, len(myList))
        if(myList[j] &lt; myList[i])
            swap(myList[i], myList[j])
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Remark 1</strong> Can we prove that this will always work? In algorithms we must prove that an algorithm will return the correct output and run under specific time bounds. This is beyond the scope of this tutorial but I will provide an example below for those who are interested.</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>


<p><strong>Proof</strong> This proof will be pretty informal but for the purpose of this tutorial it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. Selection sort works because, in each step, you find the smallest thing left and put it where it belongs. By the time you’ve gone through all the steps, everything is in the right place.</p>
<p>Think of organizing a deck of cards: you look for the smallest card, put it at the front, then look for the next smallest card, and so on. Since you&rsquo;re always finding the smallest and putting it where it should go, by the end, everything is perfectly sorted!</p>
<p>In all algorithms courses and in research we always look for two fundamental pieces when an algorithm is presented, a proof of its time complexity and a proof of correctness.</p>

    On generalization
</div>
</h3>
<p>Notice in the examples above, in searching and sorting we were able to take a simple task such as searching for the number 15 or determining the order of two integers and then generalize to arbitrary sets of data. Ultimately this is exactly what we do in order to solve the hardest problems in computer science. Think back to the robot problem from the beginning of this tutorial, we wanted to address the task of retrieving a strawberry from a refrigerator. Now imagine we wanted to generalize this algorithm to work on arbitrary item, not necessarily a strawberry and also imagine we wanted to generalize the location of the item. What you are now thinking would be an example of a more sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithm. In many cases we can generalize a problem enough and reframe it to solve a seemingly unrelated problem. For example what if instead of a strawberry in a kitchen setting we were in a torn down town after a natural disaster and the objective is to find survivors. This is a much more complicated task as the size of the space we are searching has become exponentially larger and the stakes are higher as we are searching for human life.</p>
